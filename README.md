# Smart Health Monitoring for Classrooms

This project monitors distance and temperature using an ultrasonic sensor and a DHT11. If someone is close (< 100 cm) and temperature is high (>10Â°C), a buzzer will alert.

## ðŸ“¦ Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- DHT11 Temperature Sensor
- Buzzer
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## ðŸš€ Features
- Distance sensing
- Temperature monitoring
- Buzzer alert system

## ðŸ”§ How It Works
1. Ultrasonic sensor measures distance
2. DHT11 reads temperature
3. If both conditions are met â†’ buzzer turns ON
